# Demon Slayer Transition
A simple visual experiment inspired by *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba* — a popular Japanese anime series.

## Overview
This project displays an image that reveals a smooth transition effect when hovered over with the mouse. The effect is designed to evoke cinematic-style transitions commonly seen in well-edited anime sequences, with specific inspiration from *Demon Slayer*. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
The goal of this project is to showcase an interactive hover animation using HTML and CSS. It is a visual, front-end-only implementation — no JavaScript is required.
This project was inspired by the visually dramatic transitions and style of the anime *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba*.
